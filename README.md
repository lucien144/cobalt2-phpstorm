# Cobalt 2 Theme for PhpStorm
⚠️ **Still in WIP.**

This theme is inspired by [WesBos'](http://wesbos.com) [Cobalt 2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2) for SublimeText. May work for other JetBrains' products, such as IntelliJ but, it's not been tested.

I'm focusing on PHP syntax only, but other syntaxes may come when I'll need them (CSS, HTML, JS, Coffee, Eslint, ...)

➡️ Any PR is welcomed.

Thanks and enjoy.

## Installation

### macOS
```
# Close PhpStorm
cd ~/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm2016.2/colors/
git clone git@github.com:lucien144/cobalt2-phpstorm.git .
# Now open your PhpStorm > Preferences > Editor > Colors & Fonts > Scheme > Cobalt 2 > Apply
```

- The `colors` folder should be empty before cloning otherwise you get git error.
- The path may differ based on your PhpStorm version.
